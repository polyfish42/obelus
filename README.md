# the-witness-puzzle-game

# MVP

Gamers will draw a line from the beginning to the end of a line puzzle, while separating blocks of different colors with that line.

# Technologies, Libraries, API
I will be using Vanilla Javascript, HTML5 Canvas, and CSS for this project. I anticipate that the biggest technical challenge will be figuring out the correct data structure for the puzzle and the algorithim for checking to see if the puzzle is solved.
